## Malloc Implementation
This project implemnets malloc, calloc, realloc functions with use of segregated explicit lists. This gives memory utilisation of 59% on the curated memory traces. Better fit algorithm and eliminating footers in allocated blocks boost the memory utilisation to around 70% but hampers the throughput of the system.
